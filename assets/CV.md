## Profile

I am a mathematician at King’s College London and full stack developer looking for a mid-
level programming role, with 3 years of industry experience working with various
languages and frameworks and 10 years coding in a recreational capacity.
My personal projects have included both practical coding work and the study of the more
abstract and theoretical aspects of computer science.
In particular, I completed a module on numerical and computational methods at university
and have chosen the topic of the mathematical underpinnings of functional programming
for my final year dissertation.

## Hobbies & Interests

When not bashing through equations or writing code, I like to keep fit through a mix of climbing, cycling, yoga, and running.
