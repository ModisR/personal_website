## Profile
I am a mathematician at King’s College London and full stack developer looking for a mid-
level programming role, with 3 years of industry experience working with various
languages and frameworks and 10 years coding in a recreational capacity.

My personal projects have included both practical coding work and the study of the more
abstract and theoretical aspects of computer science.

In particular, I completed a module on numerical and computational methods at university
and have chosen the topic of the mathematical underpinnings of functional programming
for my final year dissertation.

## Key Skills
- Functional Programming: lambda expressions, currying, combinators, type classes, functors, monads
- HTML5, CSS3, ES6
- Bootstrap, Schema.org SEO
- Less, Stylus Jade, CoffeeScript
- Haskell, Scala, JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, C, C++
- Play Framework, Symfony, Wordpress
