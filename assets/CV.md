## Profile
I am a mathematician at King’s College London and full stack developer with 5 years of industry experience and 12 years coding in a recreational capacity.

While having worked with various languages and frameworks, my specialty is in Scala, SBT, and Play Framework. I used these tools extensively to develop a financial modeller for Actuarial Apps and a 3rd party OAuth2 app to collect study participants’ Fitbit data in collaboration with a King’s College London research team.

Furthermore, I have explored a passion for combining geometry with code through hobby projects plotting Newton fractals and iterated function systems programmed in Scala.

As a mathematician, I have worked to vertically integrate my practical experience with theoretical knowledge by completing a module on numerical and computational methods at university and writing a dissertation on the mathematical underpinnings of functional programming.
